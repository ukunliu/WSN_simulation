# Wireless sensor networks simulation and localization

## Introduction

This project develops a simulator in MATLAB and explores localization techniques under different conditions

## Simulation

The Matlab simulator is built with `.m` scripts under `data_simulation` folder, where `cell_generation.m`  is the main file for data generation. 

The folder `maps` stores open street data for simulation cities, and `dataset` stores simulated data in `.mat` format.

## Localization

File `main.ipynb` is for developing localization algorithms.
